HW8 - implementation SelfReview


EXPERIENCE REVIEW:

In terms of our own design, the only thing that we wish we could have done was to create an
interface for our PlayerController class, as it currently implements the two Feature interfaces,
which caused a little confusion with one of our customer groups. Outside of that, there isn't
anything that we believe needed to be redesigned/implemented in our code. As of the code that was
given to us, we learned the power of adapters when it came to working with another group's code, and
saw in action the idea of flexibility with Interfaces and the idea of how they can be used to swap
implementations. It's something that neither of us had every worked with before, nor had the idea
that something like swapping code and making it work was even possible. As for the updates we had to
make for our customers, there was nothing drastic, just one instance where we didn't use an
Interface type, leading to a small bit of confusion.

Our experience with our providers (not code related) was solid. Our providers were quick to respond
to any emails looking for any clarification on their code, and were helpful in their responses.
They were, however, late to send us their code, which hindered progress for us a little.
